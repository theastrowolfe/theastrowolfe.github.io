      <description>Conquering the exam. Credits
The IT industry has numerous ways to break into it and quickly progress in the field! A tried and true method is through IT certifications. Whether youâ€™re starting your career, expanding your expertise, or needing to comply with policies and mandates - certifications are a proven option! Many vendors offer certifications, of which I highly recommend CompTIA because their certifications are widely recognized and accepted by industry.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a guilty pleasure of mine, but I LOVE buying domains. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember when or how it all started, but it&amp;rsquo;s more addictive than PokÃ©mon - I GOTTA CLAIM &amp;lsquo;EM ALL! ðŸ˜‚
However, not everyone appreciates this perspective&amp;hellip; A while back, an article hit the front page of HackerNews describing how terrible domain parking is. I&amp;rsquo;m guilty of this, but I don&amp;rsquo;t regret it. From side projects to creative domains, it&amp;rsquo;s fun to grab a good URL and throw something up there!</description>

      <description>A Set-UID program is like any other Unix program, except that it has a special marking, which is a single bit called a Set-UID bit. This tells the operating system that when the process is executed it should have the effective user ID of the owner user ID. This is privilege granted also applies to child processes of this program.</description>

      <description>Hugo: The world&amp;rsquo;s fastest framework for building websites. Credits
This blog is made with Hugo. &amp;ldquo;The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites.&amp;rdquo;1 Basically, it is a static site generator built in go. This means when it is time to build a website, it&amp;rsquo;s very fast. However, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the actual building and tweaking of the site fast&amp;hellip;
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t agree with it&amp;rsquo;s claim that it makes building websites fun again either.</description>
