I'm Joshua, a software engineer by day and a scientist by night. I'm constantly
pursuing various ways to leave a [positive impact][goals] on the world.

Feel free to drop me a line at [developer.wolfe@gmail.com][email] or ping me
on twitter at [@theastrowolfe][twitter]!

## My Values

{{< expandable label="Embrace The Weird" level="1" >}}
Doing non-traditional, "radical" things tends to yield "radical" results.
{{< /expandable >}}

{{< expandable label="Feed My Curiosity" level="1" >}}
It's important to explore new interest and unknown subjects without the fear
of judgement or failure.
<br/>
{{< blockquote author="Jake the Dog" >}}
Dude, suckin' at something is the first step to being sorta good at something.
{{< /blockquote >}}
{{< /expandable >}}

{{< expandable label="Rapid Experimentation" level="1" >}}
Ideas alone are worthless. It's execution that matters and makes the
difference. To solve real-world problems, build and iterate until a valid
solution is made.
{{< /expandable >}}

{{< expandable label="Others > Myself" level="1" >}}
I feel most empowered and purpose driven when I'm serving others or
volunteering. I believe making the world a better place starts with doing the
right thing and helping others.
{{< /expandable >}}

{{< expandable label="Do The Hard Things" level="1" >}}
Solving real-world problems doesn't come with included instructions. It's grit
and perseverence that energizes and drives building the future.
