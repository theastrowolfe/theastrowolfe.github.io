pursuing various ways to leave a [positive impact][goals] on the world.

<h2>My Values</h2>

{{% expandable label="Embrace The Weird" level="1" %}}
Doing non-traditional, "radical" things tends to yield "radical" results.
{{% /expandable %}}

{{% expandable label="Feed Curiosity" level="1" %}}
It's important to explore new interest and unknown subjects without the fear
of judgement or failure.

{{% expandable label="Rapid Experimentation" level="1" %}}
Ideas alone are worthless. It's execution that matters and makes the
difference. To solve real-world problems, build and iterate until a valid
solution is made.

{{% expandable label="Others > Myself" level="1" %}}
I'm feel most empowered and purpose driven when I'm serving or volunteering.
I believe making the world a better place starts with doing the right thing
and helping others.

{{% expandable label="Do The Hard Things" level="1" %}}
Solving real-world problems doesn't come with included instructions. It's grit
and perseverence that energizes and drives building the future.
