{{< section "My Values" >}}

{{< details "Embrace The Weird" >}}
Doing non-traditional, "radical" things tends to yield "radical" results.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Feed My Curiosity" >}}
It's important to explore new interest and unknown subjects without the fear
of judgement or failure.

{{< quote "Jake the Dog" >}}
Dude, suckin' at something is the first step to being sorta good at something.

{{< details "Rapid Experimentation" >}}
Ideas alone are worthless. It's execution that matters and makes the
difference. To solve real-world problems, build and iterate until a valid
solution is made.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Others > Myself" >}}
I feel most empowered and purpose driven when I'm serving others or
volunteering. I believe making the world a better place starts with doing the
right thing and helping others.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Do The Hard Things" >}}
Solving real-world problems doesn't come with included instructions. It's grit
and perseverance that energizes and drives building the future.
