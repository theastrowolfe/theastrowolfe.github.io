This blog is made with [Hugo][hugo]. "The world‚Äôs fastest framework
for building websites."[^1] Basically, it's just a static site generator built
in [go][go]. When it comes time to compile, or build, the site it's pretty
fast. It obviously doesn't make actually building and tweaking the site fast
though.

<br>

I wouldn't agree with it's claim that it makes building websites fun again
either. There is a large theme selection which is nice. However, with so many
themes it's hard to find the right one. I ended up going with the
[cupper][cupper] theme since it was responsive and had a simple design to it.
I had to tweak a good bit of it after cloning to get the exact look and feel I
wanted. So, expect a pull request in the near future with my edits! üòÅ

<br>

Overall, the experience was decent and I'm happy with the results! I recommend
[Hugo][hugo] if you're okay with momentary confusion during development and
experimenting with themes, layouts, configs, taxonomies, pages, and more.
