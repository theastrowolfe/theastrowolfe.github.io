This blog is made with [Hugo][hugo]. "The worldâ€™s fastest framework
for building websites."[^1] Basically, it is a static site generator built in
[go][go]. This means when it is time to build a website, it's very fast. However,
it doesn't make the actual building and tweaking of the site fast...

I wouldn't agree with it's claim that it makes building websites fun again
either.  There is a large theme selection, which is initially helpful, but it was
impossible to find the right theme that had *everything*.  I ended up going with the
[Cupper][cupper] theme due to its simplistic design.  However, I had to tweak a
significant amount of small things to achieve the **exact** look and feel I wanted.

Difficulties didn't stop there.  After revisiting this blog over a year later, I
quickly realized Hugo projects **are not** very portable.  This could be due to my
novice understanding of how Hugo worked, but was still an annoying inconvenience.
To build my website and begin posting again, I ended up learning the inner workings
of Hugo.  While this wasn't the easiest task, it did present the opportunity to
incorporate new features into my website.

Overall, the experience was decent and I'm happy with the final result!  I recommend
[Hugo][hugo] if you're okay with momentary confusion throughout development and
experimenting with themes, layouts, configs, taxonomies, pages, and more.
