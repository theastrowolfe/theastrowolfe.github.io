The IT industry has numerous ways to break into it and quickly progress in the
field! A tried and true method is through IT certifications. Whether youâ€™re
starting your career, expanding your expertise, or needing to comply with
policies and mandates - certifications are a proven option! Many vendors offer
certifications, of which I highly recommend [CompTIA][comptia] because their
certifications are widely recognized and accepted by industry.

Over the coming months, I'll dive into [CompTIA certificates][certs] to
renew an expired cert and pick up a few new ones along the way! You don't have
to follow the same path as me. CompTIA has a [recommended order][cert-paths] to
earn certificates depending on your goal and where you are in your career.

For me, my goal is the **CompTIA Security Infrastructure Expert (CSIE)**,
which is one of their "[stackable certifications][stack-certs]." Stackable
certifications follow two career pathways:

* [CompTIA Infrastructure Career Pathway][infra-path]
* [CompTIA Cybersecurity Career Pathway][cyber-path]

Each pathway has stackable certifications organized by experience level:

* **Specialist**: Early-career IT professional with 0-2 years of experience
* **Professional**: Mid-level IT professional with 2-5 years of experience
* **Expert**: Established IT professional with 5+ years of experience

> **Note:** At the time of writing, only the *CompTIA Cybersecurity Career
Pathway* has Expert level stackable certifications.

To get the CSIE, I'll be going after the following certifications:

1. CompTIA Security+
2. CompTIA PenTest+
3. CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+)
4. CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+)

The Security+ is a core certification that I highly recommend for beginners!
I've earned the certificate once before but inadvertently let it expire. From my
experience, the exam isnâ€™t challenging, and TONS of resources are available. The
PenTest+ is a more difficult exam that is the most comprehensive exam covering
all pentesting stages, including all aspects of vulnerability management. The
CySA+ is more or less just incident detection, prevention, and response. The 
CASP+ is an advanced-level certification that is very hands-on.

In short, IT certifications are worth it to get your foot in the door or show
competency in a given field! From foundation knowledge to  advanced, hands-on
skills, certifications are a quick way to prove someone has the minimum
required skills to perform a specific job.
