The IT industry has numerous ways to break into it and get ahead in your
career. One of the quickest is through IT certifications. Whether youâ€™re
starting your career, expanding your expertise, or needing to comply with
policies or mandates - certifications are the way to go! Many vendors offer
certification, of which I highly recommend [CompTIA][comptia] due to being 
widely recognized and accepted.

Over the coming months, I'll be diving into [CompTIA certificates][certs] to
renew expired certs and pick up new ones along the way! You don't have to
follow the same path as me. CompTIA has a [recommended order][cert-paths] to
earn certificates depending on your goal.

Personally, my goal is the **CompTIA Security Infrastructure Expert (CSIE)**,
one of their "[stackable certifications][stack-certs]," which follow two career
pathways:

* [CompTIA Infrastructure Career Pathway][infra-path]
* [CompTIA Cybersecurity Career Pathway][cyber-path]

{{< linebreak >}}

Each pathway has stackable certifications organized by experience level:

* **Specialist**: Early-career IT professional with 0-2 years of experience
* **Professional**: Mid-level IT professional with 2-5 years of experience
* **Expert**: Established IT professional with 5+ years of experience

> **Note:** Only the *CompTIA Cybersecurity Career Pathway* has Expert level
stackable certifications.

So, to get the CSIE, I'll be pursuing the following certifications:

1. CompTIA Security+
2. CompTIA PenTest+
3. CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+)
4. CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+)

{{< linebreak >}}

The Security+ is a core certification that I highly recommend for beginners! The
exam isnâ€™t challenging, and there are TONS of resources for it, both paid and
free. I canâ€™t speak from experience past Security+ but will share my thoughts
and comments as I progress through the following certs.
