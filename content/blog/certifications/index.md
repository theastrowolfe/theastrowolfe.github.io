The IT industry has numerous ways to break into it and get ahead in your career.
One of the quickest is through IT certifications. Whether you're starting your
career, expand your expertise to get promoted, or need to be compliant per a
policy or mandate - certifications are the way to go! There are tons of vendors
issuing certs, but I highly recommend [CompTIA][comptia] due to being widely
recognized and accepted. There are also tons of study material and large
communities committed to helping you pass the exams.

Over the coming months, I'll be diving into [CompTIA certificates][certs] to
renew expired certs and pick up some new ones along the way! You don't have to
follow the same path I'm going to take. CompTIA has a
[recommended order][cert-paths] to get certificates depending on your goal.

Personally, my goal is to be a **CompTIA Security Infrastructure Expert (CSIE)**,
one of their "[stackable certifications][stack-certs]," which follow two career
pathways:

* [CompTIA Infrastructure Career Pathway][infra-path]
* [CompTIA Cybersecurity Career Pathway][cyber-path]

{{< linebreak >}}

Each pathway has stackable certifications organized by experience level:

* **Specialist**: Early-career IT professional with 0-2 years of experience
* **Professional**: Mid-level IT professional with 2-5 years of experience
* **Expert**: Established IT professional with 5+ years of experience

> **Note:** Only the *CompTIA Cybersecurity Career Pathway* has Expert level
stackable certifications.

So, to get the CSIE, I'll be pursuing the following certifications:

1. CompTIA Security+
2. CompTIA PenTest+
3. CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+)
4. CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (CASP+)

{{< linebreak >}}

The Security+ is a core certification that I highly recommend for beginners! The
exam isn’t challenging, and there are TONS of resources for it, both paid and
free. I can’t speak from experience past Security+ but will share my thoughts
and comments as I progress through the following certs.
