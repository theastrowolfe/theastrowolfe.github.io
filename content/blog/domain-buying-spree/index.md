It's a guilty pleasure of mine, but I **LOVE** buying domains. I don't
remember when or how it all started, but it's more addictive than PokÃ©mon - I
GOTTA *CLAIM* 'EM ALL! ðŸ˜‚

However, not everyone appreciates this perspective... A while back, an
[article][hn_article] hit the front page of HackerNews describing how terrible
[domain parking][wiki_domain_parking] is. I'm guilty of this, but I don't
regret it. From side projects to creative domains, it's fun to grab a good URL
and throw something up there!

In my opinion, the author seems pretty upset over the whole thing. Maybe they
missed out on a domain and used that as the culprit why they aren't the next
Mark Cuban. Regardless, there is no harm in spending $10-$20 a year for cyber
real estate.

In fact, I challenge you to buy a domain too! Use it for a personal brand, or
think of a fun, quirky URL! To give you some inspiration, here a few of my own
fun domains that redirect back to my website:

* [astrowolfe.com](http://astrowolfe.com)
* [thesoftware.engineer](http://thesoftware.engineer)
* [thefreelance.engineer](http://thefreelance.engineer)
* [iamthe.engineer](http://iamthe.engineer)
* [w0lf3.com](http://w0lf3.com)
* [4ax0r.com](http://4ax0r.com)
* [joshuawolfe.me](http://joshuawolfe.me)
* [joshwolfe.me](http://joshwolfe.me)

The whole point is that it's not a bad thing. Feel free to share some of your
own creative domains by tweeting at me!
