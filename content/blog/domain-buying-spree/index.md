It's a guilty pleasure of mine, but I **LOVE** buying domains. I don't
remember when or how it all started, but it's more addictive than PokÃ©mon - I
GOTTA *CLAIM* 'EM ALL! ðŸ˜‚

A while back, an [article][hn_article] hit the front page of HackerNews
describing how terrible [domain parking][wiki_domain_parking] is. I'm guilty
of this, but I don't regret it. From side projects to creative domains,
grabbing a good URL and throw something up there is fun! However, not everyone
shares this perspective...

The author seems pretty upset over the whole thing. Maybe they missed out on a
domain and used that as the excuse why they aren't the next Mark Cuban.
Regardless, there is no harm in spending $10-$20 a year for cyber real estate.

I challenge you to buy a domain too. Use it for a personal brand, or think of a
fun, quirky URL! To give you some inspiration, here are a few of my fun domains
that redirect back to this website:

* [thesoftware.engineer](http://thesoftware.engineer)
* [thefreelance.engineer](http://thefreelance.engineer)
* [iamthe.engineer](http://iamthe.engineer)
* [w0lf3.com](http://w0lf3.com)
* [joshuawolfe.me](http://joshuawolfe.me)
* [joshwolfe.me](http://joshwolfe.me)

The whole point is that it's not a bad thing, but rather for fun. It's just
virtual real estate!
