      <description>Conquering the exam. Credits   The IT industry has numerous ways to break into it and get ahead in your career. One of the quickest is through IT certifications. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re starting your career, expand your expertise to get promoted, or need to be compliant per a policy or mandate - certifications are the way to go! There are tons of vendors issuing certs, but I highly recommend CompTIA due to being widely recognized and accepted.</description>
