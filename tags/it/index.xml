      <description>Conquering the exam. Credits
The IT industry has numerous ways to break into it and quickly progress in the field! A tried and true method is through IT certifications. Whether youâ€™re starting your career, expanding your expertise, or needing to comply with policies and mandates - certifications are a proven option! Many vendors offer certifications, of which I highly recommend CompTIA because their certifications are widely recognized and accepted by industry.</description>
