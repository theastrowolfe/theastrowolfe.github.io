      <description>Conquering the exam. Credits
The IT industry has numerous ways to break into it and quickly progress in the field! A tried and true method is through IT certifications. Whether youâ€™re starting your career, expanding your expertise, or needing to comply with policies and mandates - certifications are a proven option! Many vendors offer certifications, of which I highly recommend CompTIA because their certifications are widely recognized and accepted by industry.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a guilty pleasure of mine, but I LOVE buying domains. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember when or how it all started, but it&amp;rsquo;s more addictive than PokÃ©mon - I GOTTA CLAIM &amp;lsquo;EM ALL! ðŸ˜‚
However, not everyone appreciates this perspective&amp;hellip; A while back, an article hit the front page of HackerNews describing how terrible domain parking is. I&amp;rsquo;m guilty of this, but I don&amp;rsquo;t regret it. From side projects to creative domains, it&amp;rsquo;s fun to grab a good URL and throw something up there!</description>

      <description>Hugo: The world&amp;rsquo;s fastest framework for building websites. Credits
This blog is made with Hugo. &amp;ldquo;The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites.&amp;rdquo;1 Basically, it is a static site generator built in go. This means when it is time to build a website, it&amp;rsquo;s very fast. However, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the actual building and tweaking of the site fast&amp;hellip;
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t agree with it&amp;rsquo;s claim that it makes building websites fun again either.</description>
